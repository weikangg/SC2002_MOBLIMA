## What is MOBLIMA?

MOBLIMA is a console based cineplex management application for both the admin and customer. Allowing a customer to register an account, view currently showing movies and making bookings based on the currently available sessions in the system. While for an administrative user they are able to edit internal settings through the application as well.

## Our Project

Through this assignment, we attempted to code this application in Java using Object Oriented concepts, such as the SOLID frame work and principals such as abstraction, polymorphism and inheritance to make our code maintainable and readable.

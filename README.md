## What is MOBLIMA?

MOBLIMA is a console-based (non-graphical UI) system designed to computerise the processes of essential services such as booking a ticket for a movie and making reviews for movies. The app has two different interfaces, one for the staff and another for the customer.

## Design Considerations

We attempted to make use of Object Oriented concepts and SOLID design principles to make our code easier to maintain and extensible.
